# Library Management System

In this assignment, a C# console application representing a library management system is developed. This system is designed to manage books, members and book lending transactions.

## Definitions

### Encapsulation

All class areas are conveniently concealed. Only accessible through properties and methods.

### Inheritance

A superclass such as `Literature`, which shares common features, was created and the `Book` class was derived from this class.

### Polymorphism

Polymorphic behavior defined for `Print()` method

### Interface

An interface such as `IPrintable` was created and used to print the information of books or members to the console.

## Usage
